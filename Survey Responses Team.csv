,,0,,Recently I went on a walk around campus that I really enjoyed. It was exciting because I had never been on this part of campus and I got to see lots of new places. It was fun to see a new side of campus!,"I'm looking forward to Halloween! I'm excited to get dressed up, eat candy, and get together with my friends.",The most fun I've had recently was when I went out to have ramen with my friends. It was the best ramen I had eaten in a long time and afterwards we went shopping which was fun as well since we joked around a lot. It felt like I was back in high school with them.,"Things have been pretty great these past 2 weeks! I've been completing my work on time getting decent grades, and I've been exercising and eating healthier than the last time I went to university in person.","If I had one extra hour every day, I would try to get some extra work done and out of the way so that I could have more freetime in the future."
,,1,,Yesterday I took a train to escape the city and go to a farm. I picked apples and raspberries from a field and bought pumpkins for halloween! It was a great day.,I am planning on buying flight tickets to go back home for Christmas,"Recently I went on a day trip with my boyfriend and we had tons of fun, in general weekends are always fun because I don’t have to go to school and I can wake up late.","Good I guess, I am always pretty busy and stressed with studying but so far I think I am achieving good results so I am quite satisfied with what I am doing.",I would love to spend the time in self care activities but knowing myself I will always have something more urgent to prioritize to complete work/study activities in advance.
,,2,,"Yes! I had some cultural events this weekend. They were a lot of fun, and I did a lot of dancing. I think I got enough cardio in for the year. They happen on a yearly basis so I already can't wait for next year.","I am looking forward to reading week. I hope I get to do something fun, maybe a trip with friends? Or maybe I'll just be at home. Regardless, I am looking forward to it.","For one of my courses, I had to do a mini field trip with my group. We had a lot of fun and somehow ended up being allowed to look through a party bus, because the driver saw us looking at the bus. It was very spontaneous and fun.",Really good for the most part. I am starting to worry about falling behind at schoolwork as midterms are approaching. I am going to try to not cram for any midterms last minute.,"I would take time to do nothing. I read a book that emphasized how important it is for the brain to just be doing nothing other than just existing. I am almost always doing something, so I'd use this time to just sit and be."
,,3,,I started school again after my internship and got the opportunity to reconnect with some of my old friends.,I am looking forward to Reading Week - I think it will give me sometime to relax and catch-up on all the sleep I have been losing over this semester.,"For Thanksgiving, my roommates and I had a small ""Friendsgiving"" potluck dinner. It was really nice spending a relaxing evening having dinner and watching family movies with my closest friends.",Things have been very busy. Between school and job-hunting I barely get any real free time and most of the free time I do get is spent fulfilling social commitments - I don't ever really get me-time.,"I would use the extra time to do something just for myself like skincare, reading, journaling, coloring, puzzles etc."
