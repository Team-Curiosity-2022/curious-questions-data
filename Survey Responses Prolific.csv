2023-01-12 14:38:59,I Agree,5d5ad9a38fd0020001d2403f,2023-01-12,"Not really anything that excites me, personally, however over the Christmas break our family was gifted an overnight at a local waterpark/hotel, so I took the children and spent two days at the waterpark with them - so it was exciting and fun for them, and exciting for me to see their excitement, even though it wasn't exactly something that excited me directly.

I don't know of any specific thing coming up, but hopefully we will get to go away in the summer for a couple of days.  Anything coming up for you?","As I mentioned earlier, we did go to the waterpark overnight, thanks to a kind gift, so that was fun, and it was fun to see how excited the children were.  ","The past two weeks have been fine - we are getting back into a regular scheadule after the Christmas break, so that can be a bit stressful to get everyone back on track, but once it is established then everything runs smoothly again until the next break, so that's nice.","Probably sleeping.... I should spend it cleaning, but it's unlikely.  If I had one extra hour to myself every day that would be different - an hour where everyone was out of the house and I could do anything I liked - I might do something creative, or read a book, or learn something new.  I find it difficult to concentrated on learning new things or creating things when the children (and husband) are all in the house being loud, demanding and needing things.  I would love some quite space to learn or to create!"
